\title{Choice of the best binary question}
\usage{
choose_question(
  X,
  Z,
  indices,
  vec_quali = c(),
  w = rep(1/nrow(Z), nrow(Z)),
  D = rep(1, ncol(Z)),
  vec_order,
  match_var
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the data matrix of dimension (nxp) where p is equal to the number of numerical variables
plus the number of categories. This matrix is used to construct the binary questions}

\item{Z}{the numerical data matrix of dimension (nxk) used to compute the inertia criterion
(the matrix of the principal components for instance)}

\item{indices}{vector of indices for the cluster A to divide.}

\item{vec_quali}{vector containing the number of categories for each modalities (according to the
categories observed in A_l)}

\item{w}{weights vector}

\item{D}{diagonal distance matrix coefficients}

\item{vec_order}{vector containing TRUE if the categories of the variable are ordered}

\item{match_var}{vector of column indices matching the variables used in the current
mtry selection to their positions in the original dataset}
}
\value{
\item{inert}{the between-clusters inertia of the bipartition (A_l, A_l_c)}

\item{A_l}{the vector of indices of the cluster A_l}

\item{A_l}{the vector of indices of the cluster A_l_c}

\item{cut_ind}{the index of the cutting variables}

\item{cut_val}{a list with : \itemize{
\item $type: the type of the cutting variable (quantitative or qualitative)
\item $value: a real value if the variable is quantitative and a biparition of categories
 if the variable is qualitative.
 The first cluster of this bipartition of categories is given by $value$bipart whereas the second
cluster is given by $value$bipart_c}}
}
\description{
This function finds the best binary question do divide a cluster A
into to subclusters such that the bipartition (A_l, A_l_c) has maximum between-clusters inertia.
}
\details{
This function works for both categorical, numerical and mixed data.
This is the core function of the divclust algorithm.
We are seeking the binary question which gives the best
bipartition. A binary question is defined with a cutting variable (quantitative or qualitative), and
a cutting value. For quantitative variable, the cutting value is a real number. For qualitative, the
cutting value is
